This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance- Water- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Linalool- Hexyl Cinnamal- Hydroxycitronellal- Benzyl Benzoate- Geraniol- Limonene- Coumarin- Citronellol- Citral- Amyl Cinnamal- Farnesol- Butylphenyl Methylpropional.Please be aware that ingredient lists may change or vary from time to time.

 A luscious- long-wearing powder eyeshadow. 

What it does:
This creamy shadow glides on in one smooth stroke for long-wearing color- and is formulated to be crease and fade resistant. It is available in soft matte- soft shimmer- or super shimmer finish. Matte finish shadows give fine lines and wrinkles a softer- smoother look. A hint of soft shimmer shadow dabbed into the center of lids adds a pop of brightness. Super shimmer shadows act as highlighting shades to bring out browbones and inner corners of eyes. Try light shades for a more dramatic effect on deeper skintones or dark shades for a more natural look. Dark shades look more dramatic on fairer skins; light ones look more natural.

Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray delights with a hint of citrus- a wealth of flowers- a mix of emotions. Continue the happy experience with rich- hydrating Body Cream and on-the-go purse spray. This set contains:- 1.7 oz/ 50 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 0.34 oz/ 10 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 2.5 oz/ 75 mL Clinique Happy™ Body Cream,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray: Alcohol Denat. - Clinique Happy Perfume (Parfum) - Water\Aqua\Eau - Butylphenyl Methylpropional - Benzyl Alcohol - Hydroxycitronellal - Limonene - Citronellol - Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone - Linalool - Citral - Geraniol.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,1,0,0

Rosemary- peppermint- and pimento add perfect piquancy to grapefruit's bright and sunny nature.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

Rolling in Love is a “white” scent- layering different textures along the scent’s trail with notes of ambrette seeds- almond milk- iris- and musk.About the Bottle: Each KILIAN bottle is transformed into a precious object. Rolling in Love  debuts a new color scheme for the iconic KILIAN flacon—an astonishing red with golden accents. The red-lacquered flacon is engraved on its various sides with a ceramic fresco representing Achille's shield and decorated with a golden plate- on which the name of the fragrance has been carved manually. True luxury should last a lifetime- and as such- this flacon is refillable.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol Denat.- Fragrance (Parfum)- Water/Aqua/Eau- Benzyl Salicylate- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Ethylhexyl Salicylate- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Linalool- Benzyl Alcohol- Coumarin- Geraniol- Hydroxycitronellal- Isoeugenol- Benzyl Benzoate- Farnesol- Citronellol- Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate. ,1,0,0,0

An intensely hydrating hand cream that helps reverse the effects of extreme dryness.

What it is formulated to do:
 Make A Difference™ Rejuvenating Hand Treatment is infused with self-hydrating rose of Jericho and skin-reviving trehalose and sea haricots- which work hand-in-hand to help skin recover from dramatic dryness. The ancient oceanic flora helps repair damage caused by UV exposure- and scutellaria extract helps to even out skin tone. Meadowfoam seed oil lavishes hands with long-lasting smoothness that's never greasy- leaving an elegant- silky feel on skin.




What else you need to know:
 Also known as the “Resurrection plant-” the rose of Jericho is an ancient species of “everlasting plants” that can withstand almost total dehydration for decades (losing 98 percent of its water content) and return to life unscathed when re-hydrated. It is famed for its hygroscopic properties- which cause it to curl up when water is scarce and unfold when moist. This plant is able to survive and regenerate its life.

If you want to know more… This is the perfect glow-to step between skincare and makeup. Smooth this super-cooling- weightless primer on skin after moisturizer and before makeup to improve the appearance of pores- smooth texture- and brighten skin. 





What else you need to know: As early as your 20s- skin starts to change. It loses its luster and needs some extra help to bounce back from everyday stress. That’s because of something called carbonylation. It’s a protein change that can lead to dullness. That’s where willowherb comes in. It helps inhibit that dullness causing protein change and restore your natural- gorgeous glow.

Sharp and pristine- the piercing prickles of the stems hook onto each other- bonding their blooms in pink perfection. A rose by any other name wouldn’t be TOM FORD.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Fragrance Description: Brilliant. Lavish. Refined. Velvet Orchid is a fragrance that lives in the black orchid world of glamorous mystique- sharing its aura yet standing apart with its own compelling identity. It pushes the D.N.A. of the original Black Orchid into new territory- evolving hidden facets of the original's olfactive structure with extravagant ingredients to reveal even more brilliance- femininity- and attractive force. 
About the Fragrance: In Velvet Orchid- the daring and dramatic floral signature of black orchid is the inspiration for a warm and enveloping fragrance that is lavished with shimmering freshness- dramatic petals- honey- and rum. The woods and spices of the original scent recede and a contrasting veil of petally floralcy casts a shadow of ultra-femininity throughout. A new character emerges: one that pulls rather than pushes; and that is more harmonious than mysterious—elegantly refined and polished. Velvet Orchid has an addicting beauty that seduces with a fluid and textured touch. It is the rippling black silk next to black orchid's sleek marble. Velvet Orchid masterfully embellishes and evolves the Black Orchid legacy.  
""To this day- velvet is my favorite fabric. The woman who wears this is not a wildflower. She’s an urban flower- she’s a hothouse flower- she’s an orchid.""—Tom Ford

Scent Type: Earthy Greens & Herbs

Key Notes: French Lavender- Italian Bergamot- Tonka Bean

Fragrance Description: An element pushed to the extreme- two distinct lavenders merge from the start. Lavender from the Hautes-Alpes region of Provence grows in the high mountains and pulses with adrenaline-pumping freshness. Lavender in the valley dries for three days- allowing the lavender oil to develop its unique character with amber-like facets. Vibrant Italian Bergamot drenches the herbaceous open with citrus.

At the heart- daucus carota—transformed through an exclusive enzyme process—eradicates earthiness and amplifies the fresher expression and orris qualities. A third pure lavender propels Lavender Extrême beyond all expectations. Lavender Absolute France punches up a balsamic core with green undertones.

The oriental dimension at the finish builds on the warm glow of wild-grown Tonka Bean. Sourced in Laos- the creamy wood effect of Benzoin hooks with a final dose of Extrême’s charismatic audacity- potent and excessively luxurious.


About the Fragrance: ""Lavender Extrême is fresh- divergent- and stimulating. Lavender is reworked and refracted to become something irreverently new—a stunning- electric creation to be worn at maximum volume.”—TOM FORD

","Suggested Usage:
-On clean skin- spray fragrance once or twice on desired areas. Do not rub the fragrance on skin- as this will alter how the fragrance develops.

Pro-Tip: Layer your fragrance with Body Moisturizer for a more sensorial experience.

With Venetian Bergamot- the sun-drenched citrus from Italy’s south is transported to the northern city of grand palazzos- remarkable canals- and the famous confluence of trade in rich florals- precious woods- and warm spices. Bergamot’s fresh elegance is underscored and intermingled with the intriguing sensuality of Venice.

Fragrance Description: Revel in an invigorating interpretation of the original Tom Ford Grey Vetiver eau de parfum enlivened with compelling warmth and heightened freshness. The cool nature of vetiver is revealed with new dimension in this citrus- woody- eau fraiche fragrance.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

 At a dinner in Paris- Too Faced Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer Jerrod Blandino had a culinary moment with a peach trifle dessert that featured peaches roasted on an open flame and caramelized.
