# WELCOME TO ASKCET BEAUTY! 😍 🎉

A place where we celebrate an inclusive beauty experience,
focusing on people with limited vision ability. 👁️ 🥳

Features we have created:
* Image color correction service to aid people with colorblindness to differentiate colors on product
* Product recognition scanner to help user identify a product better
* Searching for a product through voice
* Text to speech service
* Font resizing service 

To run the service, we need to activate both the back-end and the front-end
Further instructions are inside the folders.

For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact the team.
